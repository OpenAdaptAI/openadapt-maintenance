Cross-platform desktop app for continuous screen recording and AI training data collection, built for [OpenAdapt](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/OpenAdapt).

## What is OpenAdapt Desktop?

OpenAdapt Desktop is a system tray application (macOS, Windows, Linux) that continuously captures desktop activity -- screen recordings, mouse events, keyboard events, window metadata, and optionally audio -- for training AI agents via demonstration.

**Key principles:**

- **Raw recordings stay local** -- nothing leaves your machine without explicit review and approval
- **Human-in-the-loop scrubbing** -- PII detection and redaction with before/after comparison
- **Build-time trust guarantees** -- enterprise builds physically exclude upload code paths
- **Multiple upload backends** -- S3, HuggingFace Hub, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Magic Wormhole, or federated learning

## Architecture

```
Tauri Shell (Rust + WebView)        Python Engine (sidecar)
+----------------------------+      +---------------------------+
|  System tray icon          |      |  controller.py            |
|  Start/stop recording      | IPC  |    -> openadapt-capture   |
|  Settings panel            |<---->|  scrubber.py              |
|  Upload review UI          | JSON |    -> openadapt-privacy   |
|  Consent dialogs           |      |  storage_manager.py       |
+----------------------------+      |  upload_manager.py        |
                                    |  review.py (state machine)|
                                    |  audit.py (network log)   |
                                    |  backends/                |
                                    |    s3, hf, wormhole, fl   |
                                    +---------------------------+
```

The Tauri shell provides a lightweight native window (~2-10 MB) while the Python engine handles all recording, scrubbing, and upload logic. They communicate via JSON-over-stdin/stdout IPC.

## Recording Review State Machine

Every recording must pass through a review gate before any data can leave the machine:

```
  CAPTURED (raw on disk, blocked from ALL egress)
     |
     +-- scrub --> SCRUBBED (pending user review)
     |                |
     |                +-- approve --> REVIEWED (scrubbed copy cleared)
     |
     +-- dismiss --> DISMISSED (user accepted PII risks)
     |
     +-- delete --> DELETED
```

**All outbound paths are gated** -- not just storage uploads, but also VLM API calls (OpenAI Vision, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini), annotation pipelines, federated learning gradient uploads, and Magic Wormhole sharing.

## Storage Backends

| Backend | Use Case | Cost | Delete? |
|---------|----------|------|---------|
| Local only | Air-gapped / offline | Free | Yes |
| AWS S3 | Enterprise (GoTo, etc.) | ~$0.023/GB/mo | Yes |
| Cloudflare R2 | S3-compatible, free egress | ~$0.015/GB/mo | Yes |
| HuggingFace Hub | Community dataset sharing | Free (public) | Yes |
| MinIO | Self-hosted S3-compatible | Free (self-hosted) | Yes |
| Magic Wormhole | Peer-to-peer ad-hoc transfer | Free | N/A |
| Federated Learning | Model improvement without data sharing | Free | N/A |

Enterprise users can verify that unwanted backends are excluded at the binary level (`strings openadapt-engine | grep huggingface` returns nothing in enterprise builds).

## Project Status

This project is in **early development** (v0.1.0). The Python engine scaffold is complete with passing tests. The Tauri shell has IPC command stubs. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the full design document.

### What's working

- Python engine: config, review state machine, audit logging, storage backend protocol
- Storage backends: S3 cost estimation, Wormhole credential check, protocol conformance
- Controller: recording state enum, idle detection
- IPC protocol: JSON-over-stdin/stdout handler with tests
- CI: tests passing on all platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux) x (Python 3.11, 3.12)

### What's next

- [ ] Wire up `openadapt-capture` recording engine to the controller
- [ ] Implement PII scrubbing with `openadapt-privacy`
- [ ] Build the upload review UI (extending `openadapt-viewer` components)
- [ ] Implement S3 multipart upload
- [ ] PyInstaller sidecar bundling
- [ ] Tauri IPC wiring (Rust <-> Python sidecar)
- [ ] Native installers (DMG, MSI, AppImage)
- [ ] Auto-update via Tauri updater plugin

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip
- Rust + Cargo (for Tauri shell, optional for engine-only development)
- Node.js 18+ (for Tauri CLI)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-desktop.git
cd openadapt-desktop

# Install Python dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Lint
uv run ruff check engine/ tests/
```

### Optional extras

```bash
uv sync --extra enterprise    # S3/R2/MinIO (boto3)
uv sync --extra community     # HuggingFace Hub
uv sync --extra federated     # Flower + PyTorch
uv sync --extra full          # Everything
```
